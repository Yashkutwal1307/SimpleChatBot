## 🧠 How It Works
1. User enters a message  
2. Chatbot converts it to lowercase  
3. It checks message against categories:
   - greetings  
   - jokes  
   - feelings  
   - questions  
   - time/date  
   - insults  
   - fallback  
4. Returns the appropriate response  
5. Chat continues until "bye" or "exit"
